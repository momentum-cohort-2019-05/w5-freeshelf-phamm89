# Freeshelf

This week, you are building a Django application to collect an index of free programming books online. You'll work on this application for the entire week. The end goal is an application that allows users to see a list of all the books, register and log in, and favorite books.

## Freeshelf Deployment

## Requirements and goals

### Overall requirements

- Your application should be styled. It should be usable and aesthetically neutral, at a minimum. There is a sample mockup of the index page in [mockup/index.html](mockup/index.html). You do not have to follow this mockup -- it's just a place to start if you don't have your own ideas.
- When you are not sure about whether a feature is needed, use your knowledge of similar sites and your good sense.
- Your application should be able to run from scratch by downloading the repo, running `pipenv install`, `python manage.py migrate`, and `python manage.py runserver`. There can be another step to load data -- just make sure to update this README to include that step.

### Goal 1: books

Your first goal should be creating a Book model and showing an index of all books. Some details:

- Books have, at a minimum, a title, author, description, URL, slug, and date added to the database.
- Book URLs should be unique.
- Admins can add, edit, and delete books.
- You should have initial data for books (a CSV is provided, but you can edit it to fit your data).
- Books should be in order with the most recently added at the top.

To load some initial books, you can [create a data migration](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/migrations/#data-migrations).

#### Stretch goals

- Add an optional image for books.
- Allow users to change the order of books, ordering by title or by reverse order of being added.

### Goal 2: associated categories

Your next goal should be adding categories for books. Each book should be associated with a category.

- Categories have a title and a slug.
- Each category should have a URL that shows books just for that category.

#### Stretch goals

- Allow books to be in multiple categories.

### Goal 3: registration and login

Your next goal is adding registration and login to your application.

### Goal 4: user favorites

Once you have registration and login, users should be able to choose books as their favorites. Every user should be able to go to a URL, `/favorites/`, to see their favorite books. The books should be in order with the most recently favorited ones on top. The user can "un-favorite" a currently favorited book.

#### Stretch goals

- Show the number of times a book has been favorited on its entry.

### Bonus Goal 1: Add user comments

Users should be able to comment on books. Each book will need to have its own unique URL where you can see comments on the book. Comments should be in order from the oldest to the newest. On book listing pages (the main page and the category pages), the number of comments should be listed with the book.

#### Stretch goals

- Make user names on comments links to a user profile page. This page should show all the comments the user has made across books.

### Bonus Goal 2: Users can suggest books

Users should be able to suggest new books for Freeshelf. You can do this with a separate model or by using the Book model with a new boolean indicating whether the suggestion has been accepted or not. Either way, a new page, `/suggestions/`, should be available to admins, showing them all the current suggestions and allowing them to accept or decline the suggestion.
